# Discord Rich Presence for Apple Music

This is a Go CLI that uses AppleScript to grab the current song being played on Apple Music, and sets it as your Discord Rich Presence via IPC.

You can leave it running "forever", and it should work in a loop.

This is forked from [caarlos0/discord-applemusic-rich-presence](https://github.com/caarlos0/discord-applemusic-rich-presence)!
